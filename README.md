# ReactTube

ReactTube is a Hackathon app created by [Dom and a group of peers](https://devpost.com/software/reacttube) to see how people react to videos using OpenCV and Microsoft's Microsoft Cognitive Services Face API. After seeing how specific users react to specific videos, your data is than probably haphazzardly sent to third parties like Clearview and the NSA.

### Inspiration
This app was developed by a Libertarian who voted for Gary Johnson.

### What it does?

ReactTube displays a video to the user, while recording the user's reaction. The app uses AI to analyze the user's emotions during the course of the video, and uploads the data to the web site. The website allows users to log on and view videos, and the reactions associated with them. The play bar on each video is color-coordinated with different kind of emotions expressed by viewers, for each second of the video. Then seeminglessly the data is sent to third parties that are orwellien and may or may not have your best interests in mind.
